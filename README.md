# .dotfiles

Welcome to [ivuorinen](https://github.com/ivuorinen)'s .dotfiles repository. It's a hodgepodge of scripts
and configurations, tests and mistakes I'm not aware of yet. As I find more interesting tools, configs and
other stuff, this repository will live accordingly.

Please for the love of everything good do not use these 1:1 as your own dotfiles,
fork or download the repo as a zip and go from there with your own configs.

## Setup

### First time setup

1. Clone this repository to `$HOME/.dotfiles`
2. `bash $HOME/.dotfiles/scripts/settler.sh`
3. ???
4. Profit

Note: there's a bit chicken/egg situation, because settler assumes you don't have git,
and you need git to clone the repo. This will change soon&trade;.

## Interesting files and locations

### Special folders

| Path               | Description                                                                         |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `.github`          | GitHub Repository configuration files. Not part of the dotfiles per se.             |
| `host-{hostname}/` | Host specific dotfiles. Configurations that should apply to that host only.         |
| `local/bin`        | Helper scripts that I've collected or wrote to make life easier.                    |
| `scripts`          | Setup scripts. Some can be run many times, some are meant only for the first round. |

### dotfile folders

| Repo      | Destination | Description                                                      |
|-----------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `config/` | `.config/`  | Configurations for applications.                                 |
| `local/`  | `.local/`   | XDG Base folder, contains `bin`, `share` and `state` for example |
| `ssh/`    | `.ssh/`     | SSH Configurations.                                              |

### dfm - the dotfiles manager

`.local/bin/dfm` is a shell script that has some tools that help with dotfiles management.

### `scripts/install.sh` - dotfiles linker

The `scripts/install.sh` is a `rcm` generated shell script that does all the necessary linking.

To refresh the file, you can run `dfm dotfiles update`

## Configuration

The folder structure follows [XDG Base Directory Specification][xdg] where possible.

### XDG Variables

| Var                | Default              |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| Executables        | `$HOME/.local/bin`   |
| `$XDG_DATA_HOME`   | `$HOME/.local/share` |
| `$XDG_STATE_HOME`  | `$HOME/.local/state` |
| `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` | `$HOME/.config`      |

- `$XDG_DATA_HOME` defines the base directory relative to which user-specific data
  files should be stored. If `$XDG_DATA_HOME` is either not set or empty,
  a default equal to `$HOME/.local/share` should be used.
- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` defines the base directory relative to which user-specific configuration
  files should be stored. If `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is either not set or empty,
  a default equal to `$HOME/.config` should be used.
- `$XDG_STATE_HOME` defines the base directory relative to which user-specific state files should be stored.
  If `$XDG_STATE_HOME` is either not set or empty, a default equal to `$HOME/.local/state` should be used.
- The `$XDG_STATE_HOME` contains state data that should persist between (application) restarts,
  but that is not important or portable enough to the user that it should be stored in `$XDG_DATA_HOME`.
  It may contain:
    - actions history (logs, history, recently used files, ‚Ä¶)
    - current state of the application that can be reused on a restart (view, layout, open files, undo history, ‚Ä¶)
- User-specific executable files may be stored in `$HOME/.local/bin`. Distributions should ensure this
  directory shows up in the UNIX `$PATH` environment variable, at an appropriate place.
- `$XDG_DATA_DIRS` defines the preference-ordered set of base directories to search for data files in addition
  to the `$XDG_DATA_HOME` base directory. The directories in `$XDG_DATA_DIRS` should be seperated with a colon ':'.
